Install |CL-ATTR| from the live desktop
#######################################

The live desktop allows you to boot |CL-ATTR| in a GNOME desktop without
modifying the host system, offering the chance to explore developing
on |CL|. Better yet, launch the |CL| installer to install on your target
system.

Safe Installation
-----------------
Use this method to safely install |CL| on media with available space, or
alongside existing partitions, and accept the `Default partition schema`_.
If enough free space exists, safe installation is allowed.

.. note::

   |CL| allows installation alongside another OS. Typically, when you boot
   your system, you can press an `F key` to view and select a bootable
   device or partition during the BIOS POST stage. Some BIOSes present the
   |CL| partition, and you can select and boot it. However, other
   BIOSes may only show the primary partition, in which case you will not be
   able boot |CL|. Be aware of this possible limitation.


Destructive Installation
------------------------

Use this method to destroy the contents of the target device, install |CL| on it, and accept the `Default partition schema`_.

Disk encryption
===============

For greater security, disk encryption is supported using LUKS. Encryption is
optional.

#. To encrypt the root partition, select :guilabel:`Enable Encryption`,
   as shown in Figure 9.
